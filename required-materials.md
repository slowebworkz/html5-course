# **Required Materials and Setup Instructions**

Before starting this course, ensure you have access to the following materials and tools. Follow the setup instructions to prepare your environment for learning and practicing HTML5.

## 1. **Computer**
You will need a computer to write and test HTML code. The following operating systems are supported:
  
  - Windows (Windows 10 or later)
  - Mac (macOS 10.15 or later)
  - Chromebook (ChromeOS with Linux development enabled for offline editors)

### Setup Instructions:

  - Ensure your system is up to date by installing the latest software updates.
  - If using a Chromebook, enable Linux development mode if you plan to use offline editors.

## 2. **Web Browser**

A modern web browser is required to preview your HTML pages. You may use any of the following:

  - Google Chrome (Recommended) – [Download](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
  - Mozilla Firefox – [Download](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
  - Microsoft Edge – [Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
  - Apple Safari (Mac Only) – Comes pre-installed on macOS

### Setup Instructions:

  - Install or update your preferred web browser to the latest version for the best performance and compatibility with HTML5 features.
  - Enable the **Developer Tools** (F12 or right-click > Inspect) to debug and analyze your code

## 3. **Code Editor**
  A code editor is required to write HTML code. You can choose either an online or offline option based on your preference. Online editors allow you to see the results of changes in a live browser tab.
  
###  Online Code Editors (No Installation Required)
If you want to start coding immediately without installation, use one of these online platforms:

  - CodePen – Great for quick experiments and sharing projects.
  - Offline Code Editors (Recommended for Full Development)
  For a more robust development experience, install an offline editor:
  
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Recommended)
      - Download and install Visual Studio Code for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
      - Add useful extensions:
        - Live Server (for real-time previews)
        - HTML Snippets (for faster coding)
    - [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows Only) – A lightweight and simple editor for writing code.
## 4. **Internet Connection**

A stable internet connection is recommended for:

  - Accessing online code editors
  - Researching HTML concepts and troubleshooting errors
  - Downloading required tools and software
  - Viewing live project previews and testing web pages

### Setup Instructions:

  - Ensure your internet connection is reliable.
  - Bookmark important learning resources like [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) for reference.
